# Intro

This was a fun experiment creating a simple web forum app using Ruby on Rails.

This site allows anyone to post and comment on the forum, as long as they provide their name. 

A post can include text and an image.

Future iterations of this app might include:

* User login
* Upvoting/downvoting 
* Search/filters
* Additional testing

## Prerequisites
..* This app was build with Ruby 2.7.2p137 & Rails 6.0.3.4

### Getting Rails up and Running
1. If you don't have Rails, install in at your command prompt

    $ gem install rails

2. Create a new Rails application:

    $ rails new forumfun

3. Change directory to myapp and start the web server:

    $ cd myapp

4. Run your server by navingating your browser to [http://localhost:3000]http://localhost:3000

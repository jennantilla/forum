# README

This was a fun experiment creating a simple web forum app using Ruby on Rails.

This site allows anyone to post and comment on the forum, as long as they provide their name. 

A post can include text and an image.

Future iterations of this app might include:

* User login
* Upvoting/downvoting 
* Search/filters
* Additional testing
